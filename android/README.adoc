== Building

Before you proceed with building the app, you'll need to obtain your OneSignal app ID.

* Create a OneSignal account if you don't have one already.

* Generate a Firebase server key.
Refer to https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/generate-a-google-server-api-key[the OneSignal docs] for more information.

* Create a OneSignal app.
You can then obtain the app ID from the OneSignal dashboard.
For more information on how to find your app ID, refer to https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/accounts-and-keys[the docs].

After you've obtained the OneSignal app ID, create a `secrets.properties` file with the following contents, using your app ID instead:

[source]
--
ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=8250eaf6-1a58-489e-b136-7c74a864b434
--

To build this project, you can then use the `./gradlew assembleDebug` command (to build a debug APK) or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
