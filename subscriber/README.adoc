== Configuration

Almost everything can be configured using the link:config.toml[`config.toml`] file.
The config file should be copied to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/iot-waste-management/config.toml`.
In case the variable `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set, the path defaults to `${HOME}/.config/iot-waste-management/config.toml`
It has comments explaining each option and mentions the data type and units wherever necessary.

While configuring TLS is optional, you *must* set up one of Telegram or OneSignal notifications.

=== Telegram Notifications (Optional)

* To obtain the bot token, send a message to https://telegram.me/botfather[@BotFather] and follow the instructions there to generate a token.
For more information, refer to https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather[the Telegram docs].

* To obtain the chat ID, use on of the multiple bots that provide you your chat ID.
Alternatively, you can also search for it and find more ways to obtain the same.

=== OneSignal Notifications (Optional)

* Create a OneSignal account if you don't have one already.

* Generate a Firebase server key.
Refer to https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/generate-a-google-server-api-key[the OneSignal docs] for more information.

* Create a OneSignal app.
You can then obtain the app ID and the REST API key from the OneSignal dashboard.
For more information on how to find your app ID and API key, refer to https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/accounts-and-keys[the docs].
